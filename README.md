 **PROJECT-1-MAKE A GAME:**


 Jeopardy - the classic quiz game show with an movie theme twist. This single player game, displays 5 categories of tiles between 100 and 500 points. Select a category from 1 of the 5 tiles. Answer correctly in the form of a question, and earn the value of the tile. Be careful though, every wrong answer will deduct the value of your card from your score! Have fun!
