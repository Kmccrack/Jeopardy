 PROJECT-1-MAKE A GAME:


 Jeopardy - the classic quiz game show with an movie theme twist. This single player game, displays 5 categories of tiles between 10 and 50 points. Select a category and 1 of the 5 tiles. Answer correctly in the form of a question, and earn the value of the tile. Be careful though, every wrong answer will deduct the value of your card from your score! Have fun!
